                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

[... standard AGPL-3.0 license text continues ...]

This is the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

## Why AGPL-3.0?

PassKeyPer uses the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 to ensure:

1. **Freedom**: Anyone can use, study, modify, and distribute this software
2. **Copyleft**: Modifications must also be open source
3. **Network Protection**: Even cloud/SaaS versions must share their source code
4. **Community**: Improvements benefit everyone

## Commercial Use

AGPL-3.0 allows commercial use, but requires:
- Making your modifications available as open source
- If you run a modified version as a service, users must have access to the source

For proprietary forks or closed-source cloud services, contact us for alternative licensing.
