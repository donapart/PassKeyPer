## 📝 NOTES

### App Testing

The workspace protocol in package.json needs to be resolved for local development.
For now, the code is clean and ready on GitHub.

### Dependencies

When cloning, users should run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Known Issues

- Workspace protocol needs npm workspaces support
- Desktop app requires dependency installation
- Extension needs manual loading in dev mode
